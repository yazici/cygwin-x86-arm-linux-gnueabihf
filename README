This is a cygwin x86 arm little-endian gnueabihf gcc toolchain I use to compile
apps & kernel builds for Raspberry PI (for both B+ and B2).

The toolchain was build by awesome `buildroot' tool:
https://buildroot.org/
The enclosed `.config' file contains configuration for the toolchain build.

Enjoy
